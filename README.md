# Test: ANEWED.
A small game, to play it download the code as a .zip and open it with a browser (preferrably modern). You can delete the .zip file to get rid of the game.
## If you edit in this repoitory:
* Use two space indentation,
* Use strict mode for JavaScript:
  * write ```"strict mode"``` after ```<script>```,
* Always close empty elements:
  * ```<br>``` should be written as ```<br/>```,
* Never skip optional elements like ```<!DOCTYPE html>```, and ```<head>```,
* Nest elements properly:
  * Example: ```<p>This is a very long sentence <b>depending on who you ask.</b></p>```.
