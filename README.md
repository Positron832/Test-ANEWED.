# Test: ANEWED.
A small game, to play it download the code as a .zip and open it with a browser (preferrably modern). You can delete the .zip file to get rid of the game.
## If you edit:
* Use two space indentation,
* Use strict mode for JavaScript,
* Always close open elements,
* Never skip optional elements like ```<!DOCTYPE html>```, and ```<head>```
